## Why

Most coding agents can already hand work off to subagents. That works for one or two. With
five on a real change, it gets hard to follow.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/one-session.svg" alt="Left: many agents inside one session, where every subagent writes into the same scrollback, nobody's state is visible and none can be stepped into. Right: the same team in oat-agents, one row per agent with its state, each its own session on its own branch, and enter takes over any of them." width="100%">
</p>

Inside one session, every subagent's output lands in the same scrollback. You can't see which
one is stuck, and when one goes wrong you can't talk to it directly. All you can do is ask the
parent to pass a message along.

oat-agents takes the subagents out of the session. Each agent runs in its own tmux session,
with its own git worktree and branch, in the agent CLI's own interactive interface. One of
them, the meta-agent, leads: it splits your goal into pieces and hands each piece to a member
agent. The live view puts the whole team on one screen, one row per agent.

There is no new UI for the agents themselves. When you select one and press `enter`, you're
typing into its real session, the same as if you had opened it yourself. `ctrl+]` brings you
back to the team.

## How a Run goes

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/tui-demo.svg" alt="An animated replay of oat-agents tui: the meta-agent delegates to a planner, two workers on different backends and a reviewer; the review fails, a correction goes to a new member agent, the meta-agent asks the operator one question, and a fresh reviewer passes the fix." width="100%">
</p>

That is `oat-agents tui`. The Run is illustrative, but the layout, glyphs and keys are the
real ones.

1. You start a Run with a goal: `oat-agents meta fire --prompt "…"`. Describe the outcome you
   want, not the steps.
2. The meta-agent launches member agents with `role fire`: a planner, two workers, a
   reviewer, or whatever roles your plugin defines. It doesn't write the code itself.
3. Members write to the meta-agent through the Run inbox. One that finishes sends its report
   (`dispatch done`); one that is blocked asks a question (`dispatch ask`) and waits for the
   reply. Only the meta-agent reads the inbox.
4. When the meta-agent needs a decision it can't make from the goal, its row shows 🙋. Select
   it, press `enter` and type your answer. Otherwise it doesn't ask.
5. When a review fails, the fix goes to a *new* member agent. The failed attempt keeps its row,
   its report and its place in the workflow log.
6. The meta-agent closes the Run with `meta finish` and prints a receipt. The work is on the
   Run's `oat/<run>/…` branches, and you review and merge it.

You choose how close to work. Stay at the top: read the roster, open the meta-agent's
checklist (`ctrl+l`), or ask the meta-agent where things stand. Or go down to any member, read
its diff, and work with it directly.

## Define your team and its rules with a plugin

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/architecture.svg" alt="A plugin is a directory of Markdown and TOML: core/oat-meta-instruction.md says how the meta-agent splits the work and when it asks you, and each directory under roles/ is one kind of member agent. The core launches that team the same way for every plugin: worktrees, tmux sessions, the Run inbox, the workflow log, pods and the live view." width="100%">
</p>

How your team works lives in a plugin, a directory of Markdown and TOML. It says which
roles exist, what each one is told, which model it runs on, and how the meta-agent should
split work and when it should ask you. The core supplies the mechanism and nothing else
(ADR-0001, ADR-0004).

The example plugin ships `planner`, `worker` and `reviewer` so oat-agents does something
useful on day one. Your plugin can keep them, replace them, or add a `tester`, a
`security-auditor`, or a `migrator` that runs four at a time. A team with no planner at all
works too.

A new role is one directory with two files:

```text
team/
├── oat-plugin.toml
├── core/
│   └── oat-meta-instruction.md          # tell the meta-agent when to use your roles
└── roles/
    └── security-auditor/
        ├── role.toml
        └── instructions.md
```

```toml
# team/roles/security-auditor/role.toml
description = "Audits a change for security issues and reports findings with evidence."
start = "existing"          # run inside the worktree of the change under audit
exec_environment = false
max_concurrent = 1

[model.claude]
model = "opus"
```

```markdown
<!-- team/roles/security-auditor/instructions.md -->
# Security auditor

You start in the worktree of the change under audit. Look for injection, authorization gaps
and leaked secrets. Report each finding with the file, the line, and why it is exploitable.
```

Pin it next to the example team (or on its own), trust it once, and the next Run can use it:

```sh
oat-agents init --force --embedded --path team my-team
oat-agents plugin list --repo .          # prints the exact trust command for each plugin
```

| Want to change…                                       | Where                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Which roles exist and what they do                    | `roles/<role>/role.toml` + `instructions.md` in your plugin           |
| How the meta-agent splits work, when it asks, when it gives up | `core/oat-meta-instruction.md` in your plugin                |
| Reusable know-how a role may load                     | `skills/<skill>/SKILL.md`, listed in the role's `skills = [...]`      |
| Model, reasoning effort, or backend, per role         | `[model.claude]` / `[model.codex]` in `role.toml`, or override per repository in `.oat/roles.toml` |
| How many of one role run at once                      | `max_concurrent`, overridable per repository                          |
| Share one team across repositories                    | Publish the plugin as a git repo and pin it with `init --git <url> <commit\|latest> <name>` |

Every TOML file rejects unknown fields, so a typo fails at load time instead of being silently
ignored. The full format is in [`docs/plugins.md`](docs/plugins.md).

## Execution and isolation

`oat-agents` is a single Rust executable, and there is no server, database or daemon behind
it. A Run is branches, tmux sessions and plain files under `~/.local/state/oat-agents/`. That
includes the workflow log, an append-only JSONL file you can `tail -f`, `jq` or `grep`.

Each member agent gets a worktree on its own branch (`oat/<run>/<name>`) and a tmux session on
oat-agents' private tmux server. `meta fire` and `role fire` print the command that attaches to
it (`tmux -L oat attach -t oat_<…>`).

A role that sets `exec_environment = true` runs its build and test commands in a pod built from
your `.devcontainer/` (Kubernetes today), as long as the Run has an execution profile. The
agent itself, and everything else, stays on your machine. The live view shows `pod:…` beside
each agent, or `HOST (no pod)` in yellow when a role wanted a pod and didn't get one. If the
environment couldn't run a check, the role protocol has the agent report it as *unverified*,
never as a pass.

Agents run unattended. Nobody is there to approve each step, so oat-agents starts your agent
CLI with its permission prompts turned off. A worktree keeps each agent's work apart, but it
doesn't limit what the agent can reach, so only run oat-agents on a machine and with
credentials you'd trust an agent with.

The supported backends today are Claude Code and Codex. You choose one per role, so a single
team can mix them.

## Get started in five commands

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/quickstart.svg" alt="An animated terminal: install.sh, oat-agents init, plugin trust, meta fire, then the live view." width="100%">
</p>

**You need:** `git`, `tmux`, a Rust toolchain ([rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs), 1.85+, to
build), and at least one agent CLI installed and logged in: Claude Code (the default) or
Codex.

**1. Install with one command.** You don't need a clone: the script fetches the source into a
temporary directory, builds it, puts `oat-agents` in `~/.local/bin`, installs the
`oat-agents-cli` skill so your own coding agent can explain and drive oat-agents for you, and
then deletes the temporary directory.

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Noopher-AI/oat-agents/main/install.sh | sh
```

<details>
<summary>Other ways to install</summary>

```sh
# Pass options after `sh -s --`: another install directory, a tag or commit, binary only
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Noopher-AI/oat-agents/main/install.sh \
  | sh -s -- --bin-dir /usr/local/bin --ref <tag-or-commit> --skip-skill

# With cargo alone (binary only, into ~/.cargo/bin)
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/Noopher-AI/oat-agents

# From a checkout
git clone https://github.com/Noopher-AI/oat-agents && cd oat-agents && ./install.sh
```

</details>

**2. Point it at a repository.** With no flags, `init` pins the built-in example team.
`--local` keeps the config under `.git/`, so your `git status` stays clean.

```sh
cd ~/src/your-project
oat-agents init --local
```

**3. Trust the plugin once on this machine.** Its instructions will steer your agents, so
oat-agents won't run a plugin you haven't approved.

```sh
oat-agents plugin trust embedded --name example
```

**4. Start a Run with a goal.** Describe the outcome, not the steps. Use `--input-file` for a
longer goal, or `--agent codex` to run the meta-agent on Codex.

```sh
oat-agents meta fire --name rate-limit-login \
  --prompt "Rate-limit the login endpoint: 5 attempts a minute per account, with tests."
```

**5. Watch the team.**

```sh
oat-agents tui
```

`↑↓` picks an agent and `←→` switches between its `live`, `diff`, `timeline` and `log` tabs.
`enter` types into the selected session, `ctrl+]` gives the keys back, `ctrl+l` opens the
checklist and `ctrl+\` opens the console.

> **Tip:** Ask your own coding agent "how do I use oat-agents?". The `oat-agents-cli` skill
> that `install.sh` installed walks it through starting, observing and taking over a Run.

### Optional: run checks in pods

Set up an execution profile once per machine, and roles that ask for one run their build and
test commands in a pod:

```sh
oat-agents init --repo . --exec-profile local --exec-context <kube-context> --exec-namespace <namespace>
$EDITOR ~/.oat/exec.toml           # finish the [image] table; every field is there, commented
oat-agents env doctor --profile local
oat-agents env image  --profile local
```

`meta fire` and `role fire` report where commands will run, and warn when a role that wanted a
pod will run on the host. See [`docs/exec-environments.md`](docs/exec-environments.md).

## Words you'll see

| Word | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Goal** | What you want done, written for the meta-agent. It states the outcome, not the steps. |
| **Run** | One execution of one goal, from `meta fire` to `meta finish`. |
| **Meta-agent** | The agent that leads a Run: it splits the goal, launches member agents and reads their mail. It runs the core role `oat-meta`. |
| **Member agent** | An agent the meta-agent launched for one piece of work, as one of your plugin's roles. |
| **Dispatch** | One launch of one role: one session, one worktree, one settlement. A retry is a new Dispatch. |
| **Run inbox** | Mail from member agents to the meta-agent: reports and questions. Only the meta-agent reads it. |
| **Workflow log** | The append-only record of the Run. It's what you and the live view read. |
