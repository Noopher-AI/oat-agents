//! The seam a role launch uses to reach an execution environment.
//!
//! `role fire` only ever needs two things from this module: bring one environment up (or reuse
//! it) for a worktree, and read back what the ledger already proves about that worktree. Both
//! are behind a trait so a launch's decision to give a role an environment — and to fold the
//! ledger's reusable entries into its prompt — can be tested without a cluster.
